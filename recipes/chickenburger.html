    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken Parm burger recipe makes an absolutely outstanding burger on every level, like a handheld version of everyone's favorite chicken Parmesan.</p>
    <p>The burger is made from chicken thighs freshly ground with mozzarella and marinara, breaded and fried, and then layered on toasted garlic buns with more marinara for a true chicken Parm experience.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic        </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons panko breadcrumbs        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil        </li>
        <li>1/4 cup marinara or other prepared tomato sauce        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken, 4 ounces mozzarella cheese, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, black pepper, granulated garlic, oregano, 2 tablespoons panko breadcrumbs, olive oil, and 1/4 cup marinara sauce in a food processor. Pulse on and off until mixture is finely ground, forms a ball, and starts spinning around in the food processor. For best results, scrape down the sides of the bowl during the process.</li>
        <li>Stop the food processor and transfer chicken mixture into a bowl; cover and chill for about 30 minutes. You can proceed without chilling, but shaping patties is much easier if the mixture is cold. Using wet hands, shape mixture into 4 equal-sized patties. Wrap each patty in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled or until you are ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil.        </li>
        <li>Stir soft butter, crushed garlic, parsley, and pinch of salt together in a small bowl. Place burger buns on the prepared sheet pan, and spread with garlic butter. Dust tops with about 1 teaspoon grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, if desired. </li>
        <li>Toast in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.         </li>
        <li>Press patties out to the same size as the bun. Apply panko breadcrumbs to each patty, pressing into both sides of the patty, about 1 tablespoon each.        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. When hot, transfer in the patties, and cook until a golden brown crust forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and cook 1 minute, then spoon a little hot marinara sauce onto each. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons mozzarella cheese over each burger, cover the pan, and cook until the temperature of chicken measured with an instant-read thermometer reaches 150 degrees F (66 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes more. Rest for 3 minutes, covered, before assembling burgers.        </li>
        <li>Spoon some hot marinara sauce on the bottom of each bun, and top with chicken Parm burgers, a sprinkle of fresh parsley, and the other half of bun. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
